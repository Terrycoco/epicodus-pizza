code review 9/18

forgot to push it Friday 

The only question I have about Javascript is about collections.  Does JS have them?  In Ruby we have the singleton methods which act on all instances of the class, but is there something "baked in" for js? Or do we have to create them on our own, like I do in C# and VB?  I'm thinking about methods which can do finding, sorting, etc. for the instances of an object.   Is that normal practice?  Or is there something else I don't know about yet? And, if you do have to make another object to hold the collection, is it normal to use an array for that?
